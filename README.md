# Andrew Chafos Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

In this repo are my current solutions for the [2021 Advent of Code Competition](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Here are my current times/rankings for the challenges (On days 1, 3, and 8 I didn't start working on the problems until much after they were released; my Day 5 time is real, though)
